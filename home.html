<p>It was revealed this morning that a major high street bank has
   <strong>begun employing clever canines</strong> to perform basic data-entry
   tasks in several of its UK data centres. In a statement earlier today a
   spokesperson for the bank said that training had gone well with the
   <strong>first intake of ten pooches</strong> and that overall they were
   just happy to be involved.</p>
