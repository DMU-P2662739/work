      <h2>My Roots</h2>
       <p>long long ago, my grandma flew over from Auntigua to Leicster.Years
         later she has a child called Tricia (my mum)and then years later, after
         her first born she decides to hvae another child. (This is where I come
         in).Born on the 17th of August 2003 I left my mum's tummy having no idea
         about the rollecoaster I was about to experience!
         <h3>Growing Up In Croydon ain't easy.Let me tell you why:</h3>
        <ul>
        <li>Knife crime central</li>
        <li>People getting  attacked daily</li>
        <li>Always in the news</li>
        </ul>
        <p><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/localnews/2651817-Croydon/0">
        Here's</a> an article on Croydon recently. But years later our family
        grew from 3 to 6 inside a 2 bedroom
        flat, so we eventually moved out thankfully.<p>
        <h2>Family</h2>
        <p>I have two brothers, one sister , my mum and stepdad who I live with,
          along with my biological dad and my stepmum, and last but not least my
          girlfreind. I won't go into detail with these people as this IS a
          public website so, imma keep the focus on me for now.

        <h2>Taekwondo:</h2>
        <p>My older brother pioneered the art of kicking and punching
          into our lives, followed by my mum and then me. After that it became a
          family tradition f some sort and mum made my following siblings do it
          too. The impact Taekwondo has had on my life is immense, I've competed
          nationally, internationally and even globally many times and have
          achieved so much through the sport. My instructor,
          <a href="https://www.allentaekwondoacademy.com/">Richard Allen</a>(here
          is his website) is more like a 3rd father to me, who continuos to
          bestow wisdom to me on life every single time I see him. The 5
          Tennants of Taekwondo:Ettiqute,Modesty,Perseverance,Self Control and
          Indommitable Spirit, are all self rules that I embbed within every
          aspect of my life.I am forever grateful for the morals and ethics
          Taekwondo has taought me.

          <h2>Creativity</h2>
          <p>One of my passions is my passion to create. Whether that be a peice
          of  music, a piece of theatre to act, a skit, a photo, a drawing, a
          video or even a website, I love artistically challenging myself,
          ever improving at my craft. One of my creations I'm proud of is my
        youtube channel. Down below is my first ever youtube video,edited souly
        by me:</p>
