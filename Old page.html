       <h2>Where It All Began...</h2>
       <p>long long ago, my grandma flew over from Auntigua to Leicster.Years
         later she has a child called Tricia (my mum)and then years later, after
         her first born she decides to hvae another child. (This is where I come
         in).Born on the 17th of August 2003 I left my mum's tummy having no idea
         about the rollecoaster I was about to experience!
         <h3>Growing Up In Croydon ain't easy.Let me tell you why:</h3>
        <ul>
        <li>Knife crime central</li>
        <li>People getting  attacked daily</li>
        <li>Always in the news</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Here's an article on Croydon recently. However for as long as I lived
        there, I never truly realised how rough it was...I guess it's hard to
        realise how bad your place is when you've never really seen anywhere
        else. But years later our family grew from 3 to 6 inside a 2 bedroom
        flat, so we eventually moved out thankfully.<p>
        <h2>Taekwondo:</h2>
        <p>My older brother Darhys pioneered the art and kicking and punching
          into our lives, followed by my mum and then me.
